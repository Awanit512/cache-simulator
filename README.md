### Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. unzip the trace files
3. The simulator.c file contains 7 aggregated codes that access the trace file by name. To run for a particular trace file, change the file name in all the functions in simulator.c.
4. The separate files for each cache replacement algorithm are present under their respective file names in the 'replacement algorithm file' folder.
5. The analysis has been done in the form of a graph present in the main folder showing the variation in hit ratio for different tile sizes for different algorithms.
